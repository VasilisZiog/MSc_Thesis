# Smart Dublin

The population in large urban centers has increased significantly over the last decades,
resulting in a multitude of economic, social and environmental problems, putting their
sustainability at risk. Therefore, the need for new ideas based on the saving and proper
management of natural resources and available capital is imperative, focusing on
improving the living conditions of present city residents without jeopardizing the ability
of future generations to cover their own Needs. Here comes the idea of the "smart city",
whose implementation is drastically contributing to "Big Data" and Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT).

With the help of ICT it is possible to exploit the enormous amount of data arising
from the day-to-day activities of citizens and to develop numerous applications and
models for the export of motifs and the identification of correlations between urban data
in order to anticipate critical situations such as extreme weather, congestion and high
levels of air pollution, and thus to prevent the negative effects they cause.
In the context of this diploma thesis, using data as a case study of the city of Dublin,
data derived from sensors and traffic flow monitoring stations, weather conditions and
emissions of gaseous pollutants were explored and possible interactions /
interrelationships were investigated. In particular, data conversion and processing was
performed using Python and its appropriate libraries (NumPy and Pandas), for the
statistical analysis and visualization, the matplotlib and seaborn libraries were used,
while for the development of the prediction model the scikit-learn library.

The results of the analysis and the regression model that emerged, if supported by
the proposed modifications and extensions, can help to adopt modern techniques to
locate existing urban problems and to promote development plans and financial tools to
deal effectively with them.
